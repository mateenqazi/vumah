                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Vumah Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Vumah”, “we”, or “us”), provide an online vehicle
                  sharing platform which allows and connects vehicle owners with travelers, commuters and locals to
                  conduct business with each other by booking vehicles for their journeys. Vumah can be accessed online
                  at vumah.co.uk). Vumah’s websites, blog, and other associated services are referred to as “Vumah’s
                  Services”. When accessing the platform or using Vumah’s Services, which includes communicating on the
                  platform either with us or other Vumah users, you agree to comply with, and legally bound by, the
                  provisions of these Terms of Service, this applies even if you are not a registered user of Vumah’s
                  Services. These Terms of service rule your access to and use of Vumah’s services/platform and
                  establishes a binding legal agreement between you and Vumah.
                </p>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  The Terms of service, combined with Vumah’s Privacy Policy, applicable insurance terms and
                  certificates, and the user Policies accessible via Vumah’s Services (the “Policies”) constitute the
                  “Agreement” between you and Vumah (each a “Party” and together, “the Parties”).
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="col-12 mt-4" id="2">
                <h2>User Conduct Policies</h2>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Our user conduct policies have been curate to satisfy all parties involved in transactions on our
                  platform. However, the following frequently asked questions can guide you through invalid acts in this
                  agreement.
                </p>
                <p className="ml-4">I am involved in an unjustified damage claim. What can I do?</p>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Once a damage claim is filed, you will be asked to provide photos that will show the condition of the
                  vehicle before and after the trip. These photos will be used as evidence which would help is to
                  determine whether the damage took place during the time the vehicle was booked (which is when the
                  guest was responsible for the vehicle). How well these photos show the condition of the vehicle
                  (quality and angles of the photos) is determined by the guest and host. The final decision made on the
                  eligibility of the damage claim or the damage caused during the trip will be made by our third-party
                  claim’s adjusters and by Vumah. If, on initial review we deny the claim, an email will be sent to the
                  host. The email will explain the issues and ask for any additional evidence to support the claim. This
                  would provide the host the opportunity to make their case in their favour and having their claim being
                  approved. After this has been done, we’ll have all the documentation which has been submitted
                  reviewed, to ensure that the final decision is fair and well-informed. If Guests wish to learn more
                  about their financial obligations for damages, they can review the specifics of their
                  protection/insurance plan choices in the UK.
                </p>

                <h6 className="my-button mb-3 mt-5">Settling a dispute over a reimbursement request</h6>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Guests have 72 hours (three days) after submitting a request to either accept or dispute it. If the
                  request was submitted to the Customer Support team, the guest will be contacted once the request has
                  been opened. Once the guest has accepted the request or has failed to respond within 72 hours (3
                  days), the reimbursement will be issued, however, If your guest disputes, we’ll conduct an
                  investigation.
                </p>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  In the case that the guest disputes, we will ask both parties to submit whatever documentation you
                  have for us to review. Both parties must provide the documentation within 24 hours to your trip
                  Photos. The team will review the documentation and a decision will be made. Both parties must
                  acknowledge that a lack of documentation/evidence could result in the dispute being resolved in favour
                  of the other party.
                </p>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Different type of requests requires different types of documentation, however most documentation will
                  require the following:
                </p>
                <ol className="support-order-list">
                  <li>A photo taken within 2 hours before the trip starts</li>
                  <li>A photo taken within 2 hours after the trip has ended</li>
                  <li>The Date (date on receipts or metadata on photos)</li>
                </ol>

                <h6 className="my-button mb-3 mt-5">Commercial Hosts/Businesses</h6>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Commercial Hosts or vehicle rental businesses must collect their own reimbursement for any incidental
                  trip costs from their guests. This is due to Vumah only providing assistance for reimbursement users
                  who selected a protection plan within the platform.
                </p>

                <h6 className="my-button mb-3 mt-5">Not happy with a review you have received?</h6>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Both parties are required to write respectful and accurate reviews. Vumah’s review policy have
                  guidelines which should be followed, which if not met results in a review’s removal. Vumah makes the
                  final decision about whether to remove a review. We understand the importance of reviews for hosts who
                  are aiming for high ratings to express the quality of their service to attract guests. We also
                  acknowledge that both parties (guests and hosts) could have different perspectives on their duration
                  of the trip. This is the reason that hosts are able to respond to reviews to express their own thought
                  on the duration of the trip, but we would like to remind hosts that a single negative review out of
                  many positive reviews will not have much of an effect on the overall rating.
                </p>

              <div className="col-12 mt-4" id="3">
                <h2>Review Policy</h2>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Vumah allow hosts and guests give reviews so both parties can share their experiences with the users
                  on the platform. Leaving reviews and star ratings for every trip is encouraged, especially when a user
                  has had an positive or negative experience.
                </p>
                <p className="ml-4">
                  Once the vehicle has been returned and trip has ended, users have up to 48 hours to give a rating give
                  review of the trip. If this is not completed within the time period, you won’t be able to provide the
                  feedback. Once you submit a review, you can’t edit it. If you submit a star rating without a written
                  review, you can’t add a review later -- even if it’s within the 48-hour window. The review will be
                  visible instantly after it has been submitted.

                <p className="ml-4">
                  We understand that both parties may have different opinions about their experience during a trip and
                  that this may lead to misunderstandings. Due to these reasons, reviews are not removed unless:

                  At Vumah, we believe there could be supervening incidents outside of your control that may force you
                  to cancel a trip. Vumah operates a moderate circumstances policy which allows hosts and guests to
                  receive a refund or a waiver of cancellation penalties when certain conditions apply. If your trip
                  meets the criteria we will assist with the cancellation of the trip.

                <p>
                  For hosts, your performance metrics will not be impacted. You may also rebook your guest, if you
                  choose to do so. In the case that the guest cancels the trip in within 24 hours of the trip start
                  time, you won’t receive the payment for the trip.

                  As a customer, you acknowledge that you will be a legitimately licensed driver and present
                  verification to the host or via the platform of an up-to-date, valid driver’s license. You will attend
                  to the vehicle and any relevant accessories adequately and will take all practical precautions to
                  return the vehicle and any applied features on time and in primarily the exact condition as accepted.
                  You will not permit any individual other than a person(s) listed in the trip booking details as an
                  Approved Driver to operate the vehicle you booked.

                </h6>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  The customer that booked the trip (“main guest”) is financially liable for all physical damage to or
                  theft of a booked vehicle that happens while a trip, additionally any further expenses and charges
                  resulting from damage of any kind to the vehicle, regardless of who is found to be at fault. This
                  obligation is applicable to whether the main guest has their auto insurance.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  Main guests may be protected against damage to the booked vehicle under their third-party insurance
                  policies. Any time you reserve a vehicle on Vumah, you acknowledge that if any damage takes place to
                  the reserved vehicle during the booked trip, you will work with the business hosting “said” vehicle at
                  the specific time of your reservation.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  The main guest can limit the amount they are obligated to personally pay out in case of damage
                  occurring to the booked vehicle at the time of the trip by choosing an insurance protection plan via
                  the rental business hosting the vehicle. The restriction on the amount a main guest may be obligated
                  to personally pay out, included in any protection plan, only applies if:

                <p className="mt-3">
                  Non-commercial hosts providing a vehicle for hire on the platform are not authorized to provide
                  liability insurance to you. All insurance plans provided on the platform include protection under a
                  third-party automobile liability insurance policy. In the UK, this policy is established by
                  third-party insurance companies.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  If the guest has their insurance policy, it will be primary over the protection provided by the
                  third-party insurance company selected, dependent upon on various conditions such as applicable laws,
                  where the guest books the vehicle, and/or where the accident or damages happen. Terms and exclusions
                  apply. Learn more about Guest protection plans including insurance in the UK.

                  Booking with Commercial Hosts
                </h6>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  Where a host can provide a customer with the least legally required insurance protection via their own
                  commercial or rental policy, the host may decide to refuse protection provided by our third-party
                  insurance services and offer its policy exclusively to you as the customer. We refer to these hosts as
                  “Commercial Hosts.” You can specify particularly in the vehicle listing whether the vehicle is
                  presented by a Commercial Host.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  If you book with a Commercial Host, no third-party liability insurance, financial responsibility
                  limitations for physical damage, or roadside assistance is made available via the Vumah platform
                  services, Vumah Insurance Agency, LLC, or any third-party insurance partners, brokers, or suppliers.
                  The Commercial Host will bill you specifically for any appropriate protection plan after booking, not
                  through our platform. In these conditions, a Commercial Host may expect you to sign further paperwork,
                  provide a deposit, or pay further fees, costs, or taxes after booking, for example when picking up the
                  vehicle. A Commercial Host may also have added conditions that differ from Vumah conditions (like
                  requiring a credit card deposit). By booking a vehicle where a Commercial Host is offering you
                  insurance protection, you agree that the Commercial Host may apply additional terms and fees after
                  booking.

                </h6>
                <p className="mt-3">
                  When you book a vehicle on the Services, you must use the vehicle only for your personal use and not
                  for any commercial purposes (e.g. driving other passengers for a fee such as through Uber or Lyft or
                  delivering food or other packages) unless you have express written permission from Vumah’s Legal
                  Department in advance or as otherwise described here. You may not access a vehicle until the trip
                  start time and you must return the vehicle on time and to the correct location. You must present the
                  host with a current, valid driver’s license. You must exercise reasonable care in your use of the
                  vehicle. You are required at all times to operate the vehicle safely and in compliance with all
                  applicable laws, including without limitation, speed limits, and prohibitions on impaired or
                  distracted driving. In the event Vumah has any concern about your use of a vehicle, Vumah may
                  terminate your trip at its discretion at any time and require the return of the vehicle, including
                  recovering the vehicle on behalf of the host. You are required to wear seat belts during the operation
                  of the vehicle and to require that all of your passengers wear seat belts. You are also required to
                  meet any laws or regulations concerning child safety seats and other protections for children. You
                  must not leave the car unlocked or with the keys abandoned in the ignition. You must not engage in any
                  prohibited uses with any vehicle you book through the Services. The prohibited uses list is not meant
                  to be exhaustive. If you have any concerns about your planned use, please contact support.Vumah.com.
                  If you misuse a vehicle, you will be fully financially responsible for any related claims, loss, or
                  damage, and your protection plan may be voided. Guests also acknowledge that using a vehicle in a
                  prohibited manner or otherwise breaching the Agreement may lower available liability coverage to legal
                  minimum limits, or nullify coverage, and may furthermore nullify any comprehensive or collision
                  protection and/or protection plan where allowed by applicable law.

                  You need to make sure that the vehicles hired by the third party and the add on extras which are
                  provided through the platform services. Every host is accountable for complying with all legal

                  vehicle(s) in safe and roadworthy condition.

                <p className="mt-3">
                  Moreover, please ensure that you complete a visual inspection before you begin your use of the
                  vehicle. If you see any damage in your initial inspection, you should upload photos to the Vumah
                  platform of such pre-existing damage at the start of your reservation to ensure you are not held
                  responsible for pre-existing damage. Furthermore, If you find damage on your initial inspection and
                  fail to report it, Vumah, third-party administrators, or insurance partners, may assume that the
                  damage occurred during your reservation period. If, after your initial inspection, you believe that
                  the vehicle is not safe to drive, please do not use the vehicle; instead, please contact the Vumah
                  team directly.

                  support.Vumah.co.uk. If there was an accident, you must directly report it the police. In addition,
                  you will require all reasonable efforts to secure evidence from any available witnesses and to provide
                  Vumah or third-party claims administrators with a written description of the incident and any other
                  information requested, including identity and insurance information of any parties involved in the
                  incident. Furthermore, you are also required to cooperate in any loss investigation conducted by
                  Vumah, third party claims administrators, or insurers. Following incident occurrence, you may not
                  continue to use the vehicle unless you have the explicit permission of Vumah staff. If you fail to
